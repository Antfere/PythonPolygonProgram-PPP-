# PythonPolygonProgram-PPP-
Python program which allows the user to plot points on a 2d positive plane, connects points with lines, error handling for illegal points and illegally intersecting lines, lets the user finish up the polygon by connecting the last inputted point to the first, then allows the user to place points and will return whether or not those points are inside the polygon, outside the polygon, on a polygon line, or on an edge. Includes some rudimentary testing and other miscellaneous features. Input "test" at the first prompt to run the test, if it reaches a recursion error, the test was passed.
